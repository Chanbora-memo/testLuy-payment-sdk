## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. We expect all contributors to treat each other with respect and create a welcoming environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- npm 6.0.0 or higher
- Git

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/testluy-payment-sdk.git
   cd testluy-payment-sdk
   ```

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables for testing:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your test credentials
   ```

3. Run tests to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with the following format:
- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat: add new payment method support`
- `fix: resolve rate limiting issue`
- `docs: update installation instructions`
- `test: add unit tests for retry logic`
- `refactor: improve error handling`

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests only

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functions and methods
- Write integration tests for API interactions
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested

### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup code
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup code
  });

  test('should do something specific', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'test input';
    
    // Act
    const result = await functionUnderTest(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected output');
  });
});
```

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/ES6+

- Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, async/await)
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Maximum line length of 100 characters

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors appropriately
- Use specific error types when possible
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with appropriate detail level
- Never swallow errors silently

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for all public methods
- Include code examples in documentation
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Architecture Guidelines

### File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ http/                 # HTTP client and related utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adapters/        # HTTP adapters
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ errors/          # Error classes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interceptors/    # Request/response interceptors
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/           # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/            # Example code
â””â”€â”€ tests/               # Test files
    â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Unit tests
    â””â”€â”€ integration/    # Integration tests
```

### Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favor composition when possible
- **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs early and fail with clear error messages

## Release Process

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Release Steps

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. Create a release commit: `chore: release v1.2.3`
4. Create a git tag: `git tag v1.2.3`
5. Push changes and tags: `git push origin main --tags`
6. Publish to npm: `npm publish`
